                <p>
                    Thanks to the generous donations received this month, we were able to purchase essential materials such as colored pencils, scissors, paper, and other supplies to begin working on crafts with the children. These resources are helping us create a more dynamic and engaging learning environment, enriching their spiritual and educational experience.

                    <p>
                        I was baptized into Christ in 2013 after listening for some time to a radio program produced by the Church of Christ. That same program would later become part of my ministry, as I eventually became its director.
                        Driven by a desire to grow in the Word, I went on to study at the Biblical Institute of Nicaragua. During one of our mission trips, I met my wife, Ana Amador. We later married and have now been serving the Lord together for ten years.
                        God has blessed us with two wonderful children, Jesús and Juan. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Theology at the Sunset International Bible Institute, preparing myself to serve more effectively in the Kingdom of God

                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in the Church of Christ, the daughter of Ezequiel Amador—a respected preacher in Nicaragua and longtime minister of one of the country’s oldest congregations, the Church of Christ in Sutiava.
                        From a young age, I developed a deep love for teaching children. I began serving in the children's ministry when I was just 12 years old, and I’ve remained committed to that calling ever since.
                        My vision is to expand and strengthen the ministry of teaching children, helping them grow in faith, love, and understanding of God’s Word. I believe that planting the seed of the gospel early in life builds a strong foundation for lifelong discipleship.
