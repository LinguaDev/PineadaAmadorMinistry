            <h3>The Upside-Down Kingdom</h3>
            <p>Brothers and sisters, the world measures greatness by <strong>power, position, and privilege</strong>. The greatest among us are those who are served. Yet, the disciples, James and John, were still clinging to this worldly view, arguing over who would sit at Jesus’ right and left hands—grasping for prestige even in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Christ's response in Mark 10:45 is the **Constitution of the Kingdom**. It is a <strong>foundational command</strong> that completely inverts our human nature and reveals the true standard of greatness. We must abandon the pursuit of worldly status and embrace the primary role of the disciple: the role of the servant. We will examine four essential truths about Christ's purpose that must define our lives as obedient disciples.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-one">
            <h3 id="point1">The Identity of the Servant: "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served..."</h3>
            <p>Jesus Christ is the eternal King, yet He voluntarily surrendered the rights of deity while on earth. He had every right to demand homage, but instead, He chose the path of voluntary humiliation (Philippians 2:5-8). His identity as the <strong>"Son of Man"</strong> (a title of ultimate authority) is intrinsically tied to the role of the humble servant.</p>
            
            <h4>Reversing Expectations</h4>
            <p>The <strong>incarnation itself</strong> was an act of service. If the Master of the universe chose servanthood as His primary defining role, then demanding status or privilege is an act of spiritual rebellion for any disciple. Our identity in Christ means we forfeit the right to demand service.</p>
            
            <p>The true mark of a disciple is not found in the title they hold, but in the <strong>posture of their heart</strong>—a heart willingly bent toward the needs of others.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-two">
            <h3 id="point2">The Daily Practice: "...but to serve"</h3>
            <p>Christ’s life was a deliberate mission of service. The word <strong>"serve"</strong> (*diakoneo*) means to minister or wait tables. It implies an active, intentional, and humble engagement with the needs of others. It means doing the work that others often overlook or consider beneath their dignity.</p>
            
            <h4>Service as the Daily Work of the Church</h4>
            <p>For us, this means that service is not an occasional activity; it is the <strong>daily disposition</strong> of the Christian. Every miracle, every lesson, and every personal interaction Jesus had was an act of service. Within the Church of Christ, this service translates into our commitment to hospitality, caring for the sick and widows, teaching the unlearned, and maintaining the order and work of the assembly.</p>
            
            <p>A true disciple is actively looking for opportunities to serve their brethren and their community, making the work of the Kingdom their highest priority.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service is Priority:</strong> Placing the needs of the Kingdom above personal comfort.</li>
                <li><strong>Service is Universal:</strong> Every disciple is called to it, regardless of their public role.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-three">
            <h3 id="point3">The Ultimate Ransom: "...and to give his life as a ransom for many"</h3>
            <p>Christ's service culminated in the most profound act of sacrifice—His death on the cross. His service was not just beneficial; it was <strong>redemptive</strong>. He did not just help us; He bought us back. The word <strong>ransom</strong> (*lytron*) signifies the price paid to free one enslaved. We were slaves to sin, and the only acceptable price was the life of the sinless Son of God.</p>
            
            <h4>The Basis of Our Obedience</h4>
            <p>Because the debt was fully paid by Christ's sacrificial death, our subsequent obedience, including our service, is not a *price* we pay to earn salvation, but a <strong>grateful response</strong> to the grace we have already received. This sacrifice is the foundation of the Gospel: the death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord. Our service flows out of the certainty that our lives have been purchased by this incomparable ransom.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="scripture-focus">
                “For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.” (Mark 10:45)
            </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-four">
            <h3 id="point4">The New Covenant Mandate: Service as Obedience</h3>
            <p>In the New Testament, the true disciple is defined by obedience, and service is a primary command. This command is not optional. Jesus explicitly states that those who wish to be <strong>first</strong> must be <strong>last</strong> (Mark 9:35). The only way we prove our discipleship is by humbly serving others.</p>

            <h4>The Obedient Pattern</h4>
            <p>Just as we obey the Gospel in the <strong>burial</strong> of baptism to share in Christ's death, we commit to the Christian life through the <strong>service</strong> that shares in Christ's mission. Our service is the ongoing demonstration that we have truly submitted to His Lordship. If the spirit of servitude is absent from our lives, the genuineness of our faith must be questioned.</p>
            <p>Let us dedicate ourselves, therefore, to the New Testament pattern: not seeking recognition or status, but seeking the lowest place and the greatest opportunity to serve God by serving His people.</p>

            <h3>Measuring Your Service</h3>
            <p>Discipleship is defined by servanthood. If we truly follow Christ, we will reject the world’s definition of greatness and embrace His. Are you seeking a position, or are you seeking a place to serve? Are you waiting to be ministered to, or are you actively looking for the needs you can meet?</p>
            <p>The invitation today is to commit fully to the Lordship of Christ by adopting His very model of life. Look for the lowest place, the dirtiest work, and the person who has been overlooked. That is where Christ serves, and that is where <strong>true Christian greatness is found</strong>.</p>
