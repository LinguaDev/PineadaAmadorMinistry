            <h3>Guidance in the Darkness</h3>
            <p>Imagine walking a rough, unfamiliar trail in the pitch black of night. Every step is uncertain, fraught with danger. This image perfectly describes the Christian life in a fallen world. We are surrounded by confusion, false teachings, and seductive temptations. Where do we find the reliable, <strong>authoritative light</strong> to guide our feet?</p>
            <p>The Psalmist gives the answer in one of the most beloved verses on the Scripture’s authority: <strong>Psalm 119:105</strong>. God’s Word is the one, perfect source of illumination. Today, we break down this beautiful promise into two parts—the *immediate* guidance and the *long-term* direction—and then consider the necessary commitment to access this light.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-one">
            <h3 id="point1">The Word as Immediate Guidance: "...A lamp to my feet"</h3>
            <p>A lamp in the ancient world was small, held close to the ground, and only illuminated the very next steps of the traveler. It was not a floodlight showing the end of the journey; it was practical, immediate, and <strong>essential for the present moment</strong>.</p>
            
            <h4>Illuminating the Next Step</h4>
            <p>The Word as a <em>lamp</em> speaks to the necessity of daily, devotional study. It provides the light needed for immediate decisions: *Should I engage in this conversation? How do I respond to this sin?* The lamp of Scripture helps us overcome the practical, ethical, and moral challenges of the day. Without daily study, we stumble in darkness, making choices based on emotion or worldly wisdom rather than divine truth.</p>
            
            <p>Our commitment to daily devotion is the act of picking up that lamp and asking God to show us the next step of <strong>obedience</strong>.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-two">
            <h3 id="point2">The Word as Long-Term Direction: "...And a light to my path"</h3>
            <p>While the *lamp* illuminates the feet, the light on the <strong>path</strong> speaks to the grand, overarching direction of our lives. It is the roadmap, the comprehensive guide to God's will and purpose for us.</p>
            
            <h4>Establishing Foundational Doctrine</h4>
            <p>The Word as a light to the <em>path</em> provides us with <strong>doctrine, correction, and training in righteousness</strong> (2 Timothy 3:16). It shows us the authoritative pattern for the worship and work of the Church. It is the only source that defines the terms of salvation, the necessity of immersion, and the proper governance of the body of Christ. This "light to my path" ensures that the direction of our entire life journey—from salvation to service—is fully aligned with divine truth.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Lamp:</strong> Helps with daily ethics and immediate choices.</li>
                <li><strong>The Path:</strong> Ensures long-term doctrinal purity and spiritual direction.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-three">
            <h3 id="point3">The Commitment: Daily Devotion and Obedience</h3>
            <p>This verse is an act of possession: <strong>"Your word is..."</strong> The Word only becomes a lamp and a light when it is internalized and obeyed. A map hidden in a drawer helps no traveler; a lamp unlit provides no warmth.</p>
            
            <h4>The Discipline of the Disciple</h4>
            <p>Discipleship demands <strong>daily devotion</strong>. It requires the spiritual discipline of reading the Bible to know the mind of God, and praying to align our heart with His will. Let us reject the excuses of busyness or fatigue. The integrity of our Christian walk, the soundness of our doctrine, and the safety of our eternal soul depend on our consistent submission to the light of the Word.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="scripture-focus">
                “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Psalm 119:105)
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Walk in the Light</h3>
            <p>If you feel lost, uncertain, or exposed to the winds of false doctrine, it is because you have stepped away from the light. The call today is simple: Return to the written Word. Commit to the daily discipline that ensures your path is illuminated. Take up the <strong>lamp</strong> for your present steps, and follow the <strong>light</strong> for your eternal destination.</p>
