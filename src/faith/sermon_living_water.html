            <h3>The Thirst That Cannot Be Quenched</h3>
            <p>Friends, we gather today to look at one of the most remarkable and tender moments in the life of Jesus Christ: His encounter with a Samaritan woman at Jacob’s Well. Think about the physical setting: noon, the heat is blistering, and both Jesus and the woman are present only because of <strong>thirst</strong>. It is a time when no respectable person would draw water, yet this woman, marginalized and carrying deep emotional burdens, arrives.</p>
            <p>Jesus breaks every social and religious barrier by simply asking for a drink. But His intent is far deeper than physical refreshment. He aims to expose a spiritual thirst in her—and in us—that no earthly vessel can satisfy. The question before us today is this: <strong>What is the nature of the thirst that drives you, and what kind of water are you trying to drink?</strong> We will explore the profound contrast between the water in Jacob's well and the Living Water Jesus offers.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-one">
            <h3 id="point1">The Gift of God (John 4:10)</h3>
            <p>Jesus says to her, “If you knew the <strong>gift of God</strong>, and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” This reveals the extraordinary nature of Christ’s offer.</p>
            
            <h4>The Great Barrier and the Bridge</h4>
            <p>Notice the relationship between Jesus and the woman. She saw only the barriers: He was a Jew, she was a Samaritan, and their social interaction was forbidden. Jesus bypasses this entirely by introducing a new category: the <strong>Gift of God</strong>. Jesus is saying, “The most important thing here isn't who I am socially, but *what* I offer and *who* I am spiritually.” The gift is not the water itself, but the Giver—Jesus Christ.</p>
            
            <h4>Ignorance of True Need</h4>
            <p>The woman’s response is immediate and literal: "Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep." She couldn't conceive of anything beyond the physical need for water. This mirrors our own lives. We often try to fill our deepest spiritual void with things we can measure, draw, and carry: success, relationships, wealth, or comfort. Jesus challenges us to recognize that our deepest need requires a <strong>divine gift</strong>, not human effort.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="key-quote">
                “Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” (John 4:10)

            <h3 id="point2">The Water That Fails (John 4:13)</h3>
            <p>Jesus draws a sharp contrast between the water of the well and the water He offers: “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.”</p>
            
            <h4>The Cycle of Temporary Satisfaction</h4>
            <p>Jacob's well represents all the sources in life that offer temporary relief. Think of your habits, your distractions, or the pursuits you rely on to find happiness. They may satisfy for an hour, a day, or even a year, but they are subject to the law of diminishing returns. They force us into a <strong>perpetual cycle of consumption and thirst.</strong> The woman had come to this well five times, reflecting her own failed attempts at finding lasting satisfaction in relationships.</p>
            
            <h4>The Spiritual Futility</h4>
            <p>This verse is a direct diagnosis of the human heart outside of Christ. The things of this world—even good things—can never fill the God-shaped void within us. They are finite and their effect runs out. Every ambition, every achievement, every pleasure, if sought as the ultimate source of life, will inevitably leave us searching again. We keep drawing from the well, knowing the water will run out before sundown.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Earthly Water:</strong> Requires repeated drawing; only satisfies the body; leaves the spirit dry.</li>
                <li><strong>Living Water:</strong> Requires one initial drink; satisfies the soul forever; becomes a source for others.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="point3">The Well That Springs Up (John 4:14)</h3>
            <p>Here is the life-changing promise: “Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”</p>
            
            <h4>Never Thirst Again</h4>
            <p>Jesus promises not just a drink, but a <strong>permanent cessation of spiritual thirst.</strong> This doesn't mean we stop needing God; it means the restless, consuming search for fulfillment ends. The Holy Spirit, which is the gift Jesus gives, becomes the constant supply, making us satisfied in the Giver, not the gift.</p>
            
            <h4>From Water Pot to Well Spring</h4>
            <p>Crucially, the water does not just satisfy; it becomes an internal <strong>"spring of water welling up."</strong> We are transformed from weary seekers constantly drawing from an external source (like the woman at the well) into an internal source, a continuous spring. This living water not only sustains the believer but overflows into the world, offering eternal life and refreshment to others.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="scripture-focus">
                “Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” (John 4:14)

            <h3>Come and Drink</h3>
            <p>The message of Living Water is simple, yet revolutionary: <strong>The answer to your deepest spiritual longing is not found in what you can draw, but in what God has already given.</strong> Stop exhausting yourself drawing from the empty wells of this world—wells of approval, wells of materialism, wells of temporary pleasure. These will always leave you thirsty.</p>
            <p>The invitation stands before you today, just as it stood before the woman at the well. Recognize your thirst, recognize the true Giver, and simply ask Him. Receive the Living Water, and it will become a welling spring of eternal life within you, satisfying your soul forever. Come and drink.</p>
