            <h3>The Gift We Cannot Earn</h3>
            <p>Brothers and sisters, few words in Scripture are more comforting, yet more confusing, than the word <strong>Grace</strong>. Grace is the bedrock of our faith, the very foundation upon which our hope rests. And yet, the human heart has a natural aversion to receiving something it hasn't earned. We inherently seek merit, we crave contribution, and we often find ourselves trying to balance God’s magnificent gift with a small amount of our own works.</p>
            <p>Today, we turn to the Apostle Paul’s definitive statement on salvation found in Ephesians 2:8 and 9. This passage is a cornerstone for all who believe in the redemptive power of Christ. It tells us precisely what salvation is, how it is accessed, and, crucially, how it is *not* attained. We must allow Paul's words to silence the legalist within us and settle the matter once and for all.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-one">
            <h3 id="point1">Salvation is a Gift: “For by grace you have been saved...” (Ephesians 2:8a)</h3>
            <p>The word grace (Greek: *charis*) means unmerited or unearned favor. This is the starting point. Salvation is not a reward earned by obedience; it is a declaration of clemency and divine mercy extended to the utterly undeserving.</p>
            
            <h4>The Divine Initiative</h4>
            <p>The entire enterprise of our salvation originates in the heart of God. We were spiritually dead, unable to take a single step toward Him (Ephesians 2:1). Grace is God's hand reaching down to rescue us. If salvation originated in our effort, our obedience, or our inherent goodness, then we would always live in perpetual fear and uncertainty. But because it rests on <strong>God's perfect, stable, and boundless grace</strong>, we can have certainty.</p>
            
            <p>Paul emphasizes this fact by immediately pointing out that grace is the means of salvation. This gift is a completed act, achieved through Christ's death and resurrection. Our security is rooted in the Giver, not the fragility of the receiver.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-two">
            <h3 id="point2">The Mechanism: “...through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God...” (Ephesians 2:8b)</h3>
            <p>If grace is the gift, then faith is the hand that reaches out to receive it. Faith is the necessary, obedient response that connects us to the power of God’s grace. We must understand that faith, in the biblical sense, is never passive.</p>
            
            <h4>Faith is Obedient Trust</h4>
            <p>When Paul speaks of faith, he means not mere intellectual assent, but a whole-souled <strong>obedient trust</strong>. This faith trusts God so completely that it is willing to do what God commands. This is why when we look at the New Testament pattern, faith naturally expresses itself in repentance, confession, and the saving act of immersion (baptism) into Christ. These are not "works of merit" that earn grace; they are the <strong>conditions of trust</strong> that God has commanded for receiving the gift of grace.</p>
            
            <p>Notice that Paul quickly qualifies faith: "...and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." Even the capacity to trust, the opportunity to hear the gospel, and the conviction to obey are all ultimately rooted in God's grace and divine provision.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Faith is the Path:</strong> It is the chosen means by which God allows us to access the salvation He provided.</li>
                <li><strong>Faith is Active:</strong> It demonstrates its sincerity through obedience to the commands of Christ.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-three">
            <h3 id="point3">The Condemnation: “...not of works, lest anyone should boast.” (Ephesians 2:9)</h3>
            <p>This verse delivers a fatal blow to all human pride and self-righteousness. Paul explicitly excludes <strong>works of merit</strong>—any effort, rule-keeping, or ceremony performed with the intention of earning God’s favor or contributing to one's own salvation.</p>
            
            <h4>Works of Merit vs. Works of Obedience</h4>
            <p>We must clearly distinguish between two types of "works":</p>
            <p>First, <strong>Works of Merit:</strong> These are acts we perform to justify ourselves before God, to gain salvation, or to earn a higher spiritual standing. These are condemned because they negate grace and breed boasting.</p>
            <p>Second, <strong>Works of Obedience/Service:</strong> These are acts performed *after* salvation, motivated by gratitude for the grace already received. These acts, such as being immersed, assembling, or serving the poor, are the expected <strong>fruit</strong> of genuine faith, not the root of salvation.</p>
            
            <p>The ultimate goal of grace is to prevent boasting. If we could point to anything we did—whether it was following the Law perfectly or performing some great deed—then we could stand before God and claim some percentage of the glory. Grace ensures that the entirety of the glory belongs to God alone.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="scripture-focus">
                “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9)
            </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section closing">
            <h3>The Purpose of Grace</h3>
            <p>We are saved *by* grace, and we access that gift *through* an obedient faith. That is the foundation. But Paul does not stop here. Though verse 9 condemns works as a *means* of salvation, verse 10 immediately tells us we are saved *for* something:</p>
            <p>We are "His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them" (Ephesians 2:10). The Christian life is a life of good works, not as a price we pay for salvation, but as the grateful, necessary consequence of receiving it.</p>
            <p>Let us never confuse the cause with the effect. Grace is the cause; works of service and obedience are the necessary effect. If you have received this great gift through faith in Christ, let your life today be a resounding testimony to the overwhelming grace you have been given.</p>
