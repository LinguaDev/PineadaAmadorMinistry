            <h3>The Path to Redemption</h3>
            <p>Brothers and sisters, the most crucial question a person can ever answer is: <strong>How am I saved?</strong> Paul gives us a profoundly simple yet deeply demanding answer in Romans 10:9. This verse distills the Gospel down to two fundamental, necessary acts: one internal, and one external. This is the bedrock confession of the Christian faith, establishing the necessary terms for the Lord's people.</p>
            <p>We are going to study this verse today to ensure our understanding of salvation is built on the clear, complete foundation of the New Testament. We must see how this foundation of belief and confession leads directly into the <strong>full pattern of the Gospel</strong>—the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ—which we are commanded to obey.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-one">
            <h3 id="point1">The Internal Commitment: "Believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead..." (Romans 10:9b)</h3>
            <p>The first requirement is faith, and it must be seated <strong>in your heart</strong>. This is not mere intellectual agreement with historical facts, but a total spiritual conviction that drives us to action. What must we believe?</p>
            
            <h4>Belief in the Gospel Pattern</h4>
            <p>Paul highlights the <strong>Resurrection</strong> because it is the divine proof that Christ is Lord and that His sacrifice was accepted. The resurrection validates the entirety of the Gospel message: that Christ <strong>died</strong> for our sins, was <strong>buried</strong>, and <strong>rose again</strong> on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). To truly believe in the resurrection is to surrender your life to the reality of the Risen Lord. This saving belief is the spiritual engine that initiates the entire obedient process.</p>
            
            <p>This heart-belief is not passive; it is a <strong>trust</strong> that compels us toward repentance and full submission to His will.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="key-quote">
                “...if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” (Romans 10:9)
            </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-two">
            <h3 id="point2">The External Declaration: "...Confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord..." (Romans 10:9a)</h3>
            <p>The second requirement is the <strong>Confession</strong>. The internal conviction of the heart must be validated and declared externally. To confess "Jesus is Lord" (*Kyrios*) is a public declaration of His deity and sovereignty over every aspect of your life.</p>
            
            <h4>Confession as Surrender</h4>
            <p>True faith can never remain silent or hidden. This confession is the public, verbal testimony of that internal belief. It is a necessary act of <strong>surrender</strong> because it formally recognizes Christ's authority over our lives. It declares that we are no longer self-governed, but are slaves of Christ. This public act is essential because, as Paul states later in this same chapter, "with the mouth confession is made unto salvation" (Romans 10:10).</p>
            
            <p>This confession marks the transition from private belief to public discipleship and prepares the heart for the next, complete act of obedience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Confession is Testimony:</strong> It fulfills the command to bear witness to Christ.</li>
                <li><strong>Confession is Surrender:</strong> It formally recognizes Christ's <strong>Lordship</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-three">
            <h3 id="point3">The Obedient Fulfillment: Dying and Rising with Christ</h3>
            <p>The culmination of Romans 10:9 is the promise: <strong>"you will be saved."</strong> But how does this foundational belief and confession achieve the promised forgiveness of sins? It does so by leading the penitent believer to the New Testament act that completes the Gospel pattern in their life: <strong>Baptism</strong>.</p>
            
            <h4>Obedience to the Gospel's Pattern</h4>
            <p>The Gospel is Christ's <strong>death, burial, and resurrection</strong>. God mandates that we reenact this pattern through immersion. Paul teaches this explicitly:</p>
            <blockquote class="scripture-focus">
                “Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:3-4)
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Baptism is not a mere symbolic ritual; it is the act of obedient faith where God accomplishes the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is the believer’s <strong>death</strong> to sin.</li>
                <li>It is the believer’s <strong>burial</strong> with Christ.</li>
                <li>It is the believer’s <strong>resurrection</strong> to walk in a new life.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this act, the heart-belief and the mouth-confession find their physical expression. It is the place where God applies the saving blood of Christ and grants forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38; 22:16). The man who truly believes and confesses will submit to the <strong>burial</strong> of baptism to share in Christ's <strong>resurrection</strong> and be saved.</p>

            <h3>Complete Your Response</h3>
            <p>The path is clear. Have you believed in your heart that God raised Jesus? Have you confessed with your mouth that He is Lord? If you have, then the foundation is laid. Now, let that saving faith lead you to the complete obedience that God commands: <strong>Repentance</strong> of sin and the saving act of <strong>Immersion</strong> into Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.</p>
            <p>Do not hold back from the final, necessary act of faith. Complete your response to the grace offered by God, and walk today in the fullness of salvation found only through obedience to the Gospel of the Death, Burial, and Resurrection.</p>
