            <h3>The Most Precise Clock in the Bible</h3>
            <p>Brothers and sisters, we often hear that the Bible is a book of faith, but it is also a book of **mathematical and historical precision**. Daniel 9:24-27 is perhaps the most remarkable prophecy in all of Scripture. While Daniel was praying for the end of the Babylonian captivity, God sent the angel Gabriel to reveal a much larger timeline—not just for the return from exile, but for the arrival of the Messiah Himself.</p>
            <p>To understand this "Context of Prophecy," we must look at it through the lens of history, the original language, and the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ. This is not just a lesson in history; it is a demonstration of the <strong>sovereignty of God over time</strong>.</p>

        <section class="sermon-section point-one">
            <h3>I. The Scope: Seventy Weeks of Years</h3>
            <p>The prophecy begins with a specific decree: <em>"Seventy weeks are determined for your people."</em> In the Hebrew mind, and in the context of the Sabbatical years (Leviticus 25), a "week" (*shabuwa*) refers to a period of <strong>seven years</strong>. Thus, 70 weeks equals 490 years.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="scripture-focus">
                "Seventy weeks are determined for your people and for your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sins, to make reconciliation for iniquity..." (Daniel 9:24)
            </blockquote>

            <p>God lays out six specific goals for this period. Notice that these goals—finishing transgression and making reconciliation—could only be fully accomplished by the <strong>perfect sacrifice of Christ</strong>. The timeline was set to prepare the world for the Gospel.</p>

        <section class="sermon-section point-two">
            <h3>II. The Countdown: From the Decree to the Messiah</h3>
            <p>The prophecy gives us a starting point: <em>"The going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem."</em> History records this decree by Artaxerxes Longimanus in **444/445 B.C.** (Nehemiah 2:1-8).</p>
            
            <h4>The Division of the Weeks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>7 Weeks (49 years):</strong> The time taken to rebuild the walls and streets of Jerusalem in "troublesome times."</li>
                <li><strong>62 Weeks (434 years):</strong> The period of silence and waiting until the appearance of the "Messiah the Prince."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If we follow the biblical calendar (360 days per year), the math leads us with startling accuracy to the very week of <strong>Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem</strong>. God did not leave the world guessing; He told us exactly when the King would arrive.</p>

        <section class="sermon-section point-three">
            <h3>III. The Cutting Off: The Final Week</h3>
            <p>Daniel 9:26 tells us that after the 62 weeks, the Messiah would be <em>"cut off, but not for Himself."</em> This is the language of substitutionary atonement. Jesus was "cut off" (executed) on the cross, not for His own sins, but as the **ransom** for many.</p>
            
            <p>In the middle of the final week, the prophecy says <em>"He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering."</em> When Jesus died, the veil was torn, and the Old Covenant sacrificial system was rendered obsolete. He became the final Sacrifice that Daniel saw from five centuries away.</p>

            <h3>The Certainty of God's Word</h3>
            <p>Why does this matter to us in 2026? Because if God was that precise about the <strong>first coming</strong> of Christ, He is equally certain about His <strong>second coming</strong> and the promises He has made to us today. History is not a series of accidents; it is the unfolding of God’s plan.</p>
            <p>Let this study strengthen your faith. We serve a God who knows the end from the beginning. May we be found as Daniel was—faithful, prayerful, and students of the Word—as we wait for the final fulfillment of all things in Christ.</p>
