            <h3>Beyond Ink and Paper</h3>
            <p>Brothers and sisters, many people approach the Bible as a historical relic or a collection of ancient wise sayings. But the writer of Hebrews presents a different reality. The Scripture is not a dead letter; it is a **dynamic, living force**. When we speak of the "Original Intent," we are not just talking about what a human author meant 2,000 years ago, but what the **Holy Spirit** continues to do through those words today.</p>
            <p>Hebrews 4:12 serves as a "divine warning" and a "spiritual scalpel." It reminds us that we do not just study the Bible; the Bible studies us. Let us explore the three characteristics of the Word that reveal its divine origin and intent.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-one">
            <h3>I. Living and Powerful (Zon kai Energes)</h3>
            <p>The Greek text uses two potent words: <em>Zon</em> (Living) and <em>Energes</em> (Active/Energizing). Unlike any other book, the Bible has "life" in itself because its Author is the Living God. It never becomes obsolete; its "original intent" is as fresh today in Nicaragua as it was in the first century.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="scripture-focus">
                "For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword..." (Hebrews 4:12)
            </blockquote>

            <p>Because it is <em>energes</em>, the Word produces results. It convicts the sinner, comforts the brokenhearted, and guides the lost. If your spiritual life feels stagnant, it is likely because you have stopped allowing the **active energy** of the Word to work in your soul.</p>
        </section>

        

        <section class="sermon-section point-two">
            <h3>II. The Precision of the Two-Edged Sword</h3>
            <p>The metaphor of the "two-edged sword" (*machaira*) refers to a short, highly precise instrument used by Roman soldiers. It wasn't a clumsy weapon of blunt force; it was designed for <strong>precise penetration</strong>.</p>
            
            <h4>Piercing to the Division</h4>
            <p>The Word has the unique ability to divide what we cannot: "soul and spirit, joints and marrow." In our human languages, we often confuse our emotions (soul) with our spiritual standing (spirit). The Word of God cuts through the confusion, revealing the truth of our condition before God.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>It exposes the Heart:</strong> It goes beyond our outward religious "masks."</li>
                <li><strong>It demands a Response:</strong> You cannot encounter the "sharpness" of the Word and remain indifferent.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-three">
            <h3>III. The Discerner of Thoughts and Intents</h3>
            <p>The word "discerner" (*kritikos*) gives us our English word "critic." The Bible is the only book in the world that **critiques its reader**. It evaluates the "thoughts and intents of the heart."</p>
            
            <p>Understanding the original intent of Scripture requires us to submit our own "intents" to God. We do not come to the Bible to make it say what we want; we come to hear what God has already said. The *Original Intent* is always to lead us to Christ, who is the Word made flesh (John 1:1).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section closing">
            <h3>Yielding to the Scalpel</h3>
            <p>A sword can either protect or it can perform surgery. God’s Word often hurts before it heals. If you feel "pierced" by a sermon or a passage of Scripture, do not turn away. That is the <strong>Original Intent</strong> of the Author—to cut away the dead tissue of sin so that new life can grow.</p>
            <p>Let us commit to being a people of the Book. Not just people who own Bibles, but people who are <strong>owned by the Truth</strong> found within them. Open your heart to the living, active, and sharp Word of God today.</p>
