            <h3>When God is the Witness</h3>
            <p>In a world where "love" is often treated as a fleeting feeling and divorce is seen as a simple administrative exit, we must ask: What does God think of our unions? In the days of the prophet Malachi, the people were weeping at the altar because God no longer accepted their offerings. They asked, "Why?"</p>
            <p>God’s answer was direct and piercing. He pointed to the way they were treating their wives. He reminded them that marriage is not a temporary agreement between two humans, but a <strong>divine covenant</strong> where God Himself is the primary witness. Today, we will explore the profound implications of living in a covenant-based home.</p>

        <section class="sermon-section point-one">
            <h3>I. The Vertical Dimension of Marriage</h3>
            <p>We often think of marriage as a horizontal relationship (between husband and wife). However, Malachi 2:14 introduces the vertical dimension: <em>"The Lord has been witness between you and the wife of your youth."</em></p>
            
            <blockquote class="scripture-focus">
                "Yet you say, 'For what reason?' Because the Lord has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, with whom you have dealt treacherously; yet she is your companion and your wife by covenant." (Malachi 2:14)
            </blockquote>

            <p>When you said "I do," you weren't just making a promise to a person; you were making a vow in the presence of the Almighty. Therefore, to fail in your marriage is not just a personal disappointment—it is a <strong>breach of covenant</strong> with God. We must recover the fear of the Lord in our homes.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-two">
            <h3>II. Contract vs. Covenant</h3>
            <p>It is essential to understand the difference between how the world views marriage (a contract) and how the Bible defines it (a covenant):</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Contract</strong> is based on protection: "I will do my part if you do yours." It is conditional and focused on personal rights.</li>
                <li><strong>A Covenant</strong> is based on sacrifice: "I am committed to you regardless of what you do." It is an unconditional promise patterned after God’s love for Israel and Christ’s love for the Church.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The "Companion" of Your Youth</h4>
            <p>Malachi uses the word <em>companion</em>. This implies more than just a roommate; it speaks of a partner in the mission of life. Dealing "treacherously" or unfaithfully with a spouse is a direct attack on the image of God that the marriage unit is supposed to project.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-three">
            <h3>III. Guarding the Spirit of Faithfulness</h3>
            <p>How do we protect this covenant? Malachi 2:15-16 gives us the key: <em>"Therefore take heed to your spirit."</em> Unfaithfulness doesn't start in the bedroom; it starts in the <strong>spirit</strong> and the mind.</p>
            
            <p>To guard the covenant, we must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultivate Spiritual Unity:</strong> Seeking God together so that He remains the center of the cord of three strands (Ecclesiastes 4:12).</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Forgiveness:</strong> Covenants are kept by people who are quick to repent and even quicker to forgive, remembering the "ransom" Christ paid for us.</li>
                <li><strong>Reject Treachery:</strong> This includes emotional distance, harshness, and any form of neglect that violates the sacred bond.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section closing">
            <h3>A Call to Renewal</h3>
            <p>Perhaps your marriage has felt more like a weary contract than a vibrant covenant lately. God is calling us today to return to the <strong>sanctity of our vows</strong>. He is a God of restoration who hates divorce but loves the repentant heart.</p>
            <p>If you have dealt treacherously in thought, word, or deed, today is the day to "take heed to your spirit." Let us commit to building homes that honor the Witness who stands between us, making our families a true testimony of God's unfailing faithfulness.</p>
