            <h3>The Foundation of Society</h3>
            <p>Brothers and sisters, the family is not a human invention or a social evolution. It is a <strong>divine institution</strong> established by God Himself. Today, the world attempts to redefine the family, but as disciples of Christ, we must return to the original blueprint found in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>In Ephesians 5 and 6, the Apostle Paul reveals that the family is the primary place where our <strong>submission to Christ</strong> is put to the test. A godly family is a reflection of the Gospel itself. We will examine the three pillars of the Christian home: the role of the wife, the responsibility of the husband, and the duty of parents and children.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-one">
            <h3>I. The Heart of the Home: Wives and Submission</h3>
            <p>The word <strong>submission</strong> is often misunderstood today. In the biblical context (*hypotasso*), it is a voluntary act of placing oneself under the leadership of another out of reverence for Christ. It is not about inferiority, but about <strong>divine order</strong>.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="scripture-focus">
                "Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord." (Ephesians 5:22)
            </blockquote>

            <p>A wife's submission is an act of worship. When a Christian wife supports the leadership of her husband, she is modeling the Church's relationship with Christ. This is a powerful testimony of trust and order within the home.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-two">
            <h3>II. The Head of the Home: Husbands and Sacrifice</h3>
            <p>If the wife is called to submit, the husband is called to something even more demanding: <strong>sacrificial love</strong>. Paul does not command husbands to "rule" with an iron fist, but to love as Christ loved the Church.</p>
            
            <h4>The Standard of Christ</h4>
            <p>Christ's love for the Church was <strong>self-giving and purifying</strong>. A godly husband is the spiritual protector of his wife’s soul. He must be willing to die for her, but more importantly, he must <strong>live for her</strong> by setting aside his own comforts for her spiritual well-being.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leadership is Service:</strong> The husband leads by being the first to serve.</li>
                <li><strong>Love is Nourishing:</strong> He cares for his wife as he does his own body, providing security and tenderness.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-three">
            <h3>III. The Future of the Home: Children and Parents</h3>
            <p>The godly unit is completed by the relationship between parents and children. This is the first place where a child learns about <strong>authority and grace</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Children are commanded to obey their parents "in the Lord," for this is right. It is the first commandment with a promise. However, a great responsibility lies upon the father:</p>

            <blockquote class="scripture-focus">
                "And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord." (Ephesians 6:4)
            </blockquote>

            <p>We must not lead our children through frustration or inconsistent discipline. Instead, we are called to **discipleship at home**. Our goal is not just to raise "good kids," but to raise faithful servants of the Living God.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section closing">
            <h3>Is Your Home a Sanctuary?</h3>
            <p>A godly family is the greatest evangelistic tool we have. When a husband loves sacrificially, a wife supports respectfully, and children obey sincerely, the world sees a glimpse of the <strong>Kingdom of Heaven</strong>.</p>
            <p>The invitation today is to repent of worldly patterns in our homes and embrace God’s design. Let us make our houses places where Christ is the undisputed Lord, and where the Gospel is lived out every single day.</p>
