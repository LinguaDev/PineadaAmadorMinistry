            <h3>More Than Raising Good Citizens</h3>
            <p>Brothers and sisters, our goal as Christian parents is not merely to raise children who are polite, successful, or well-educated. Our divine mandate is to raise **servants of the Living God**. In a world that is fighting for the hearts and minds of our youth, neutrality is not an option. If we do not intentionally train them in the way of the Lord, the world will intentionally train them in the way of destruction.</p>
            <p>Proverbs 22:6 is often quoted, but frequently misunderstood as a "guarantee" rather than a **principle of sowing and reaping**. Today, we will examine what it means to truly "train up" a child in the way he should go.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-one">
            <h3>I. The Meaning of "Train Up"</h3>
            <p>The Hebrew word for "train" (*hanak*) is fascinating. In ancient times, it was used to describe a midwife rubbing the palate of a newborn with crushed dates to create a **desire or thirst** for food. It was also used in the dedication of a building.</p>
            
            <blockquote class="scripture-focus">
                "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it." (Proverbs 22:6)
            </blockquote>

            <p>Therefore, training our children is about **creating a spiritual thirst** for God. It is not about forcing outward rules, but about making the Gospel so beautiful and consistent in our homes that they grow to hunger for the things of Christ. We are dedicating their lives to a holy purpose.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-two">
            <h3>II. "In His Way": Recognizing Individuality</h3>
            <p>The phrase "in the way he should go" can also be translated as "according to his way." This implies that as parents, we must <strong>study our children</strong>. God has given each child unique bents, talents, and even weaknesses. </p>
            
            <h4>Intentional Observation</h4>
            <p>Training requires us to be present. We cannot train by "remote control." We must know their fears, their dreams, and their struggles. Whether we are teaching them at the **Sutiava Church of Christ** or around our own dinner table, our instruction must be tailored to lead their specific heart toward the cross of Christ.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Our lives must match our words (Deuteronomy 6:7).</li>
                <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Discipline is an act of love that mirrors God's discipline of us (Hebrews 12:6).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section point-three">
            <h3>III. Dependency in Times of Trial</h3>
            <p>Raising godly children also means showing them how to **depend on God during difficult times**. Children learn more from seeing how we handle a crisis than from a thousand lectures. </p>
            
            <p>Whether it is a financial struggle or a health trial—like we have recently experienced with our sons <strong>Juan and Jesús</strong> recovering from their illness—our children need to see us praying, trusting in God's provision, and expressing gratitude for the support of the brotherhood. When they see us leaning on the Lord, they learn that God is not a "story" in a book, but a <strong>Present Help in trouble</strong> (Psalm 46:1).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sermon-section closing">
            <h3>A Legacy for Eternity</h3>
            <p>The promise "he will not depart from it" reminds us that the seeds we sow in the early years have deep roots. They may wander, but the "thirst" for God we cultivated will call them back. Parents, do not grow weary in doing good.</p>
            <p>Let us dedicate ourselves today to be intentional trainers. Let us repent of our passivity and take up the mantle of spiritual leadership in our homes. Our children are our first and most important mission field.</p>
